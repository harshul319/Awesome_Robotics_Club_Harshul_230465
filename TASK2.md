 Bandit over the wire-
 Level 1- ls to veiw folders in the directory and cat readme to access the file readme
 
 Level 2- ls to veiw folders in the directory and cat <- to access the file - (< or ./ should be used to read files initiated with -)
 
 Level 3- ls to veiw folders in the directory and cat "spaces in this filename" to access the file 'spaces in this filename'(so it reads whole as a single string)
 
 Level 4- ls to veiw -> we get inhere directory -> cd to get into inhere -> ls -a to show hidden files -> cat .hidden to veiw .hidden file
 
 Level 5- ls to veiw -> we get inhere directory -> cd to get into inhere -> ls to view -> find . -type f | xargs file to find files in all the directories and then also state the type of the file -> only file 7 has the human readable file which is the password
